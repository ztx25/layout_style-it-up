# Style it up

Your task is to change `style.css` in order to get the page in `index.html` 
looking and behaving just as described below.

Please **do not** modify or replace the HTML itself. Do take a look at what’s 
inside `index.html` though.

The page consists of a header, a footer, and 9 blocks between them.

The width of the blocks must be 300 pixels. The height of each of the blocks 
(including both header and footer) has to be 100 pixels. When hovered (the 
cursor is on the block), it must increase to 200 pixels.
The color of the header must be blue, the color of the footer must be black, and 
the colors of the blocks in between must be red, then green, then orange, then 
again red, then green, then orange, and once again red, then green, then orange.

There should be no vertical spacing between the blocks and the edges of the 
page. Place the blocks so that they are horizontally centered on the page (you 
can use `margin: auto` for that).

You can find some sample screenshots in the [backstop_data/bitmaps_reference](backstop_data/bitmaps_reference) folder.
